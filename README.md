```
# Scrapper Frontend

This is the frontend for the Scrapper application, built with Next.js. It provides a user interface to view and scrape RSS feeds, integrated with the backend API.

## Features
- Displays a list of feeds and their items.
- Allows users to scrape feeds and view the latest items.
- Handles user authentication with Firebase.
- Responsive design with a clean UI.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (16.x or later)
- npm (or yarn)
- Backend running at `http://localhost:8080`

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kwabena369/scrapper-frontend.git
   cd scrapper-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file with:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
     FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
     FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
     FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
     FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
     FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
     FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
     ```
   - Obtain Firebase config from your Firebase Console.
4. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:3002` in your browser.

## Usage
- Navigate to `/feed/:id` to view a specific feed (e.g., `/feed/683992d1d712dbfef549a6c3`).
- Click "Scrape Feed" to fetch new items.
- Authenticate via the `/auth` page if required.

## Development
- Use `npm run lint` and `npm run format` for code quality.
- Add components in the `components` directory.
- Extend API calls in `lib/firebase.js` or `pages/api` if needed.

## Contributing
Submit issues or pull requests. Follow React and Next.js best practices.

## License
MIT License (specify if different).

### Instructions for Use
1. **Backend README:**
   - Copy the first block of text.
   - Create a file named `README.md` in the root of your backend repository (`github.com/kwabena369/scrapper-backend`).
   - Paste the content into `README.md` and save.
2. **Frontend README:**
   - Copy the second block of text.
   - Create a file named `README.md` in the root of your frontend repository (`github.com/kwabena369/scrapper-frontend` or the `TryOut/` directory if that’s your frontend root).
   - Paste the content into `README.md` and save.
3. **Verify Rendering:** Open the `README.md` files in a Markdown viewer (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, or any Markdown editor) to ensure the formatting looks correct with headers, lists, and code blocks.

### Additional Notes
- **Customization:** Replace placeholders like `your-project-id`, `your-api-key`, etc., with your actual Firebase credentials. Update the repository URLs if they differ.
- **License:** Specify your actual license if it’s not MIT.
- **Previous Discussion on Go vs. Next.js:** As mentioned earlier, while we could have implemented the backend logic in Next.js, using Go sets you up for better scalability and performance in the future (e.g., concurrent scraping, scheduled tasks). Let me know if you’d like to explore those enhancements!

Let me know if you need further adjustments to the READMEs or want to dive deeper into Go’s capabilities! Your project is looking great!
